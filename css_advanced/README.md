# CSS Advanced

In this Advanced CSS task, we take on the challenge of styling HTML code from  the *HTML advanced* repository.  

All styling is done with pure CSS without using libraries or frameworks.  
Of course, it would have been easier without the restrictions, **but** the goal is to learn. So the challenge is very welcome.

I utilize -:  
- *Flex-box*  
- *Grid-box, and  
    other CSS layouts and properties to create a beautiful website.*  

CSS can be a lot sometimes, but what good thing isn't? So...

*Happy Coding!*
